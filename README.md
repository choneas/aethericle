## ⚠️ Project Status & Transparency
### Why Open Development?
1. **Community-Driven Ethos**  
   We believe open-source fosters trust and collaborative improvement while strictly adhering to [《崩坏3》同人衍生作品创作指引 V3.0](https://bh3.mihoyo.com/news/695/120990).

2. **Legal Compliance**  
   Keeping the code public ensures full transparency about data handling practices, demonstrating zero unauthorized data retention.

3. **Iterative Development**  
   As an **actively developed prototype**, early access allows community feedback to shape priorities. Expect breaking changes.

<!-- ### What's Unstable Now?
- API response parsing may fail on rare edge cases.
- Mobile responsiveness needs optimization.
- Fan-fiction export/import is incomplete. -->
